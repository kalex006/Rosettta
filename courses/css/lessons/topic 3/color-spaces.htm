        <h2>The Evolution of Color Models</h2>
        <p>
            Color in CSS has historically been defined by how <strong>hardware</strong> works (Red, Green, Blue LEDs). However, a Senior Architect must define color by how the <strong>human eye</strong> works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Standard color spaces like <strong>sRGB</strong> (used by HEX and RGB) can only display about 35% of the colors the human eye can see. Modern displays support <strong>Display P3</strong>, and modern CSS gives us the mathematical tools to unlock these "High Definition" colors.
        </p>

    <div class="content-block">
        <h2>1. The Legacy: HEX and RGB</h2>
        <p>
            HEX (<code>#d4af37</code>) and RGB (<code>rgb(212, 175, 55)</code>) are essentially the same. They are <strong>coordinate-based</strong> systems that tell the monitor how much light to blast from each LED.
        </p>
        <ul class="artifact-list">
            <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Universal support; easy to copy from design tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Impossible for a human to "read." You cannot look at a HEX code and know how to make it 10% darker just by changing the numbers in your head.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block">
        <h2>2. The Perceptual Flaw of HSL</h2>
        <p>
            HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) was a major improvement because it is <strong>intuitive</strong>. However, HSL is mathematically "dishonest." 
        </p>

            <div class="alert-content">
                <strong>The HSL Glitch:</strong> In HSL, a "Lightness" of 50% for Yellow looks much brighter to the human eye than a "Lightness" of 50% for Blue. This makes creating consistent accessible UI (contrast ratios) very difficult.

        <h2>3. The Future: OKLCH</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>OKLCH</strong> is the new architectural standard. It is a <strong>Perceptually Uniform</strong> color space. If you change the Hue, the perceived brightness stays exactly the same.
        </p>
        <ul class="artifact-list">
            <li><strong>L (Lightness):</strong> 0% (Black) to 100% (White).</li>
            <li><strong>C (Chroma):</strong> The "amount" of color. Unlike saturation, this has no theoretical cap.</li>
            <li><strong>H (Hue):</strong> The angle on the color wheel (0-360).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Color Gamuts: sRGB vs. P3</h2>
        <p>
            By using the <code>color()</code> function or <code>oklch()</code>, we can access the <strong>P3 Gamut</strong>. P3 contains 25% more colors than sRGB, specifically in the vibrant greens and deep reds.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the ROSETTA project, using P3 colors on high-end devices (MacBooks, iPhones, OLED screens) makes the "Ancient Gold" appear to glow with a metallic vibrance that is impossible with standard HEX codes.

        <h2>5. Color Mixing</h2>
        <p>
            The modern <code>color-mix()</code> function allows you to blend colors directly in the browser. This is essential for creating "Tint" and "Shade" systems without manually picking new HEX codes.

            <strong>Architect's Recommendation:</strong> Use OKLCH for your design system variables. It allows you to generate accessible color palettes (ensuring 4.5:1 contrast) programmatically by simply adjusting the <strong>L</strong> (Lightness) value.
