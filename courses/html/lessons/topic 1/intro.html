        <p>Before HTML existed, the world relied on <strong>SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)</strong>. SGML is not a language itself, but a <em>metalanguage</em>—a system used to define other markup languages. It established the concept of the <strong>DTD (Document Type Definition)</strong>, which dictates the rules of a document's structure.</p>

            <p>HTML was originally just an SGML application. This is why early HTML required a <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> declaration; it was the pointer telling the browser which SGML rules to follow to parse the document.</p>

        <p>In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee released "HTML Tags," a simplified subset of SGML designed for research sharing. While SGML was incredibly complex and rigorous, HTML was designed to be <strong>resilient</strong>—allowing the web to scale even if developers made small syntax errors.</p>
