        <h2>The Living Standard</h2>
        <p>
            HTML is no longer a versioned language like Python or C++. Since 2019, the <strong>WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group)</strong> has declared HTML a "Living Standard."
        </p>
        <p>
            This means there will never be an "HTML6." Instead, the browser vendors (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) continuously merge new features into the engine. As architects, we do not write for a version; we write for the <strong>platform</strong>.

        <h2>The Doctype Declaration</h2>
        <p>
            The very first line of any professional HTML document is the DOCTYPE. It is crucial to understand that <strong>this is not an HTML tag</strong>. It is a preamble instructions for the browser's parser.
        </p>
        <p>
            Historically, HTML was based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), which required a reference to a DTD (Document Type Definition). Modern HTML is its own thing, but the Doctype remains for a specific architectural reason: <strong>Rendering Modes</strong>.

    <div class="code-artifact">
        <div class="code-header">
            <span class="lang-tag">HTML</span>

        </div>

        <h2>Quirks vs. Standards Mode</h2>
        <p>
            When a browser loads a page, it decides which layout engine to use based on the presence of the Doctype.
        </p>
        <ul class="artifact-list">
            <li><strong>Standards Mode:</strong> Triggered by `&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;`. The browser renders the page according to modern CSS and HTML specifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Quirks Mode:</strong> Triggered if the Doctype is missing or malformed. The browser mimics the behavior of Navigator 4 and IE5 to support ancient websites.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="alert-box gold">
            <span class="alert-icon">⚠</span>
            <div class="alert-content">
                <strong>Critical Warning:</strong> Never omit the Doctype. Running in Quirks Mode will cause your CSS box model calculations to fail unpredictably across different devices.

    <div class="content-block">
        <h2>The Root Element</h2>
        <p>
            Immediately following the declaration is the root element: <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>. All other elements are descendants of this node. It is best practice to always include the <code>lang</code> attribute (e.g., <code>lang="en"</code>). This is not just for semantics; it is vital for accessibility tools (screen readers) and search engine logic.
